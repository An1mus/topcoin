            This is the middleware for calls to CoinMarketCap
        </h3>

        <p>
            The thing is, in docs, you may find, that new CoinaMarketCap API refuses front-end calls.
            For that purpose, I've added this middleware to process calls from the front-end application.
        </p>
        <p>
            The other possible way was to implement an app, based on old API. However,
            it could involve some unpleasant UX issues, like asking a user to turn off
            Adblock or displaying incomplete data.
            It took a bit of time, but coding extra is never extra!

            <em>Making HTTP requests on the client side with Javascript is currently
                prohibited through CORS configuration. This is to protect your API Key which should
                not be visible to users of your application so your API Key is not stolen.
                Secure your API Key by routing calls through your own backend service.
